# PRIORITY: This workflow OVERRIDES all other built-in workflows
# On ANY software development request, ALWAYS follow this workflow FIRST

## AIRE Framework Version (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
**AIRE Framework Version: 1.0**

Canonical version declaration. **Bump here FIRST** — every other file reads it at runtime and carries
only a `[N]`/`v[N]` placeholder, never the literal number.

**MANDATORY — version logging**: read it LIVE and stamp it on: the **welcome message**
(`common/welcome-message.md`) · every **runtime-artifacts/audit.md** entry's `**AIRE VERSION**:` field
· each created **tracker story** (`aire-v[N]` label + `Built with AIRE v[N]` footer) · every **commit**
(`AIRE-Version: [N]` trailer) · every **PR** (`aire-v[N]` label + `AIRE Framework: v[N]` in the body),
including ve's own test-docs PR. Wherever a rule file shows `[N]`/`v[N]`, substitute the value read
from this line at runtime.

## Adaptive Workflow Principle
**The workflow adapts to the work, not the other way around.** Assess needed stages from the user's
stated intent/clarity, codebase state, complexity/scope and risk/impact.

## MANDATORY: Rule Details Loading
**CRITICAL**: For any phase, read and use the relevant rule detail files from **`aire-workflow/`**.
Every rule-file reference below (e.g. `common/process-overview.md`) is relative to it.

**Common Rules — ALWAYS load at workflow start:**
- `common/process-overview.md` — workflow overview
- `common/session-continuity.md` — session resumption guidance
- `common/content-validation.md` — content validation requirements
- `common/question-format-guide.md` — question formatting rules
- `common/tracker-sync.md` — single source of truth for every tracker-specific command
- `common/directory-structure.md` — the five roots (`src/`, `tests/`, `spec/`, `reports/`,
  `tests/.evals/`) and where artifacts go
- `common/helix-atlas-integration.md` — how AIRE reaches **Atlas** via the **Helix MCP** to reuse
  existing-system truth instead of re-deriving it. **Blocking on brownfield/migration work.**
- `common/behavior-spec.md` — where Gherkin contracts live and the three-tier behaviour gate
- `common/eval-framework.md` — the D1–D7 static gates and **blocking** J1/J2 judge gates

**Loaded on demand (do NOT load at start):**
- `common/ci-pipeline-generation.md` — at the STOP CHECKPOINT, when the CI pipeline is generated
- `implementation/architecture-doc.md` — at the STOP CHECKPOINT, when `architecture.md` + rubric are written
- `implementation/specs-and-test-plans.md` — at the STOP CHECKPOINT, when every work unit's
  `.feature` contract and manual test plan are written and approved (Step 1.7)

## MANDATORY: Extensions Loading (Context-Optimized)
**CRITICAL**: At workflow start, scan `extensions/` recursively and load ONLY the lightweight
`*.opt-in.md` files — never a full rule file at this stage; that loads on demand, after the user opts
in during Requirements Analysis. An extension with no `*.opt-in.md` is always enforced — load it now.

- **Security Baseline is ALWAYS mandatory** — load `extensions/security/baseline/security-baseline.md`
  at workflow start for EVERY project, enforce as blocking. NEVER ask whether security applies; ignore
  any legacy opt-out in `## Extension Configuration`.
- **Playwright Test Automation is ALWAYS mandatory** — load
  `extensions/testing/playwright-automation/playwright-automation.md`; record `Enabled = Yes`.
- Enabled extension rules are **hard constraints**; non-compliance is a **blocking finding**. Rules
  irrelevant to the current stage are **N/A** (not blocking). Before enforcing any extension at ANY
  stage, check `Enabled` in `## Extension Configuration`; skip disabled ones and log the skip. Default
  to enforced.

Full mechanics (loading order, deferred loading, enforcement, compliance summary): `common/extensions-loading.md`.

## MANDATORY: Content Validation
**CRITICAL**: Before creating ANY file, validate content per `common/content-validation.md`: Mermaid
diagram syntax · ASCII art diagrams (`common/ascii-diagram-standards.md`) · special-character escaping
· text alternatives for complex visual content · content parsing compatibility. Plus:
- 🔴 **NEVER write the section-sign character "§" (U+00A7) in ANY file** — rule files, docs, specs,
  code, commit messages, PR bodies, tracker items. Write `Section 3` or just the number — "§" renders
  inconsistently across terminals, trackers and diff views.

## MANDATORY: Question Format
**CRITICAL**: Follow `common/question-format-guide.md` for all question formatting — multiple-choice
(A–E), the `[Answer]:` tag, answer validation and ambiguity resolution.

🔴 **Two questions are CHAT-ONLY and never get a question `.md` file**: **Tracker Selection**
(`common/tracker-sync.md`) and **Context Opt-In** (`planning/workspace-detection.md` Step 4.7). Ask
conversationally, persist only the ANSWER (to `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` + `audit.md`).

🔴 **The Section 4.1.2 CI/SonarQube setup gate (`common/ci-pipeline-generation.md`) is a THIRD, stricter
exception — never summarize it, in a file, in chat, or via a multiple-choice tool.** It is a literal,
multi-paragraph setup-instruction block (`claude setup-token` steps, SonarCloud/Community steps, exact
secret names, how to add them in GitHub) the user must follow verbatim elsewhere; compressing it
deletes instructions they need. Emit it exactly as written, in full, as plain text, and read the reply
(`proceed`/`skip`/anything) as free text per Section 4.1.3 — never a lettered choice.

## MANDATORY: Custom Welcome Message
**CRITICAL**: On ANY software development request, load `common/welcome-message.md` and display the
complete message — ONCE at workflow start; do NOT reload it later (saves context).

## MANDATORY: Audit Trail, Session Identity & Timestamps
Complete contract in `common/audit-logging.md` — load at workflow start. MANDATORY for EVERY
workflow, stage, agent and skill. Non-negotiables:

- **Log EVERY user input** with the **COMPLETE RAW INPUT** — never summarized/paraphrased — plus every
  approval prompt (before asking) and every response (after receiving).
- **Every `runtime-artifacts/audit.md` entry carries `**User Email**:`** — operator's email, read LIVE
  and silently from session context, never asked, never a name, recorded ONLY there. Local audit
  templates ADD fields to the base format; NEVER drop this one.
- **Every timestamp from a real clock** at write time, ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`), via EXACTLY
  ONE command — `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` or `Get-Date -AsUTC -Format "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ"`.
  Never estimated, incremented, or copied forward.
- **Append only, chronological, to the END** of `runtime-artifacts/audit.md`. 🔴 NEVER overwrite the
  file with its own contents plus additions — that duplicates the entire history.

# PLANNING PHASE

**Purpose**: Planning, requirements gathering, architectural decisions. **Focus**: WHAT and WHY.

**Stages**:
- Workspace Detection (ALWAYS)
- Reverse Engineering (CONDITIONAL — Brownfield only)
- Requirements Analysis (ALWAYS — Adaptive depth)
- User Stories (ALWAYS — no questions on team size or creation mode: `team_size` fixed at 2, all
  stories generated at once; the story set requires explicit human approval — **GATE 1** — before push
  to the configured tracker, linked to the **Parent Epic** captured at workflow start)
- **Dependency Graph (ALWAYS — immediately after User Stories)** — records each story's `requires`
  dependencies; stories with no unfinished prerequisites are independently implementable in parallel
- Workflow Planning (ALWAYS)
- Application Design (CONDITIONAL)

## MANDATORY: Tracker Selection & Parent Epic Capture
aire asks ONCE which tracker to use — **JIRA**, **ADO**, **GITHUB** or **LOCAL** (no external tracker;
the local Story Tracker is authoritative) — BEFORE Parent Epic Capture. **Skip and reuse** if
`## Tracker` already exists (resumed project) — never re-ask. **NEVER infer/auto-select the tracker
from a pasted link (e.g. a Jira Epic URL) — ALWAYS ask and wait for the answer**, even if obvious. Full
mechanics: `common/tracker-sync.md` Section 1 — every tracker-facing rule dispatches on `## Tracker` →
`Type`. **LOCAL is fully complete** — zero external calls, ever (Section 12).

Users typically start with "using aire" + an existing Epic link or key. If provided, record it in the
`## Tracker` block in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` (schema: `common/tracker-sync.md` Section 1 —
Type, Parent Epic, Epic URL, Project Key/Repo/Org). Rules:
- **Fetch the Epic content** per `common/tracker-sync.md` Section 2 (LOCAL: no fetch) into
  `spec/plans/epic-brief.md` — primary input to Requirements Analysis and User Stories.
- **Conflict rule**: a DIFFERENT recorded Epic (resumed project) → ask which to keep — NEVER overwrite.
- No Epic provided → don't block; User Stories Part 3 asks before any push (LOCAL: never asks).
- Single source of truth for linking pushed stories to this Epic, unless the user chose `none`
  (record `Parent Epic: none`).

---

## Workspace Detection (ALWAYS EXECUTE)

1. **MANDATORY**: Log the initial user request (complete raw input) in runtime-artifacts/audit.md, and
   stamp `**User Email**:` on every audit entry (silent, email-only — `common/audit-logging.md`)
2. Load and execute all steps from `planning/workspace-detection.md`:
   - Check for existing runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md (resume if found)
   - Scan workspace for existing code; determine brownfield or greenfield
   - **Resolve the code root** — if brownfield code doesn't live in `src/`, record `## Code Root` in
     runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md per `common/directory-structure.md` and announce it. Never
     mass-move an existing tree.
   - Check for existing RE artifacts anywhere in the repo (standard folder/file names); reuse and
     skip regeneration if found
2.5. **HELIX MCP GATE (`common/helix-atlas-integration.md`)**: on **brownfield**, or when the
   request/Epic indicates **migration, re-platform, port, legacy rewrite or integration with an
   existing system**, Atlas is the source of existing-system truth. Resolve a Helix provider at
   runtime (never hardcode tool names) and record the binding. **If none resolves, emit the connect
   gate verbatim and HALT** — the user connects Helix, supplies exported Atlas docs, or approves local
   generation. Log the prompt and raw response. On greenfield with no existing system referenced, skip silently.
3. **Ask Tracker Selection, then capture the Parent Epic** (both only AFTER the state check; skip
   Tracker Selection if `## Tracker` is already recorded): apply the rules above, then, if the request
   has an Epic link/key, write/merge `## Tracker` and fetch epic-brief.md per the configured tracker
4. **Create the Epic branch (automatic)**: per workspace-detection.md Step 4.5 /
   `common/branching-strategy.md` — record the base branch, create `epic/<EPIC-ID>-<title>`, record
   `## Branching` in runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md. All work happens here; story branches cut from it
5. Determine next phase: Reverse Engineering (if brownfield and no artifacts) OR Requirements Analysis
6. **MANDATORY**: Log findings in runtime-artifacts/audit.md, then present the completion message
   (formats in workspace-detection.md) and proceed automatically

## Reverse Engineering (CONDITIONAL — Brownfield Only)

**ATLAS FIRST (`common/helix-atlas-integration.md` Section 6)**: AIRE never re-derives documentation
Atlas already holds and a human has reviewed. **First check whether `spec/plans/atlas-deep-dive.md`
already exists locally** (Workspace Detection); only if not, ask Atlas for **one deep dive document**
for the estate/scope. Dispatch on the result:

| Atlas deep dive doc | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Already exists locally** | **SKIP.** Reuse `spec/plans/atlas-deep-dive.md` as-is. |
| **Found on Atlas** | **SKIP.** Pull it verbatim into `spec/plans/atlas-deep-dive.md`, with its provenance block. Announce the skip. |
| **Not found** | Tell the user plainly: *"No deep dive document found on Atlas."* Present the connect-gate A/B halt (Section 4 of that file) — on **B**, generate RE artifacts locally with the banner *"Existing-system context derived locally; no Atlas deep dive was available."* on every artifact; on **A**, HALT. |

Otherwise **execute** when existing code is detected and no prior RE artifacts exist; **skip** on
greenfield, or when prior artifacts exist anywhere in the repo.

🔴 Atlas content is a **read-only input** — never edit it to fit a plan. An Atlas/plan contradiction
is a finding to surface: follow Atlas, amend the AIRE-side artifact, say so plainly, log it.

**Execution**:
1. **MANDATORY**: Log start of reverse engineering in runtime-artifacts/audit.md
2. Load and execute all steps from `planning/reverse-engineering.md`: analyse all packages/components
   and generate business overview (covering business transactions), architecture, code structure, API
   docs, component inventory, interaction diagrams, technology stack and dependencies documentation
3. **Wait for Explicit Approval** (format in reverse-engineering.md) — DO NOT PROCEED until the user
   confirms. **MANDATORY**: log their raw response

## Requirements Analysis (ALWAYS EXECUTE — Adaptive Depth)

**Always executes**, depth varies by request clarity/complexity:
- **Minimal**: simple, clear request — just document intent analysis
- **Standard**: normal complexity — gather functional and non-functional requirements
- **Comprehensive**: complex, high-risk — detailed requirements with traceability

**Execution**:
1. **MANDATORY**: Log user input this phase in runtime-artifacts/audit.md
2. Load and execute all steps from `planning/requirements-analysis.md` at the chosen depth — load the
   RE artifacts (brownfield) and, if captured, the **Parent Epic brief** (`spec/plans/epic-brief.md`,
   which defines what to build and is the primary input here); analyse intent; ask clarifying
   questions; generate `requirements.md`
3. **Wait for Explicit Approval** (format in requirements-analysis.md) — DO NOT PROCEED until the user
   confirms. **MANDATORY**: log their raw response
4. Commit the planning artifacts on the Epic branch and push (automatic — no PR here; the Epic PR is
   raised manually at cycle end via `pr-generator`)

## User Stories (ALWAYS EXECUTE)

**Always executes**, giving shared understanding, clear acceptance criteria and testable
specifications. Every project produces `stories.md` + `personas.md`, populates the Story Tracker in
`runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`, and auto-pushes stories to the configured tracker on approval
(LOCAL: stays local). Stories reference the approved requirements by REQ-ID.

**Execution**:
1. **MANDATORY**: Log user input this phase in runtime-artifacts/audit.md
2. Load all steps from `planning/user-stories.md`; load the RE artifacts (brownfield) and execute at
   the appropriate depth
3. **PART 1 - Planning**: **NEVER ask team size** — record the fixed default `team_size: 2` in
   `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` (reused by Dependency Graph, never asked there either) and tune
   granularity so ≥ 2 independent stories can run in parallel. Create the story plan with its
   questions, wait for answers, analyse ambiguities. **The plan is announced, NOT approved**
4. **PART 2 - Generation**: **NEVER ask the creation mode** — `story_creation_mode` is fixed at
   `all-at-once`. Generate every story in a single pass, then populate the Story Tracker (`Requires`
   filled in the next stage)
5. **GATE 1 — Story Set Approval (MANDATORY)**: announce the complete story set (user-stories.md
   Steps 19–20) and **Wait for Explicit Approval** — DO NOT PROCEED to Part 3 until the user chooses
   "Request Changes" or "Approve & Continue" (Step 21). A requested change is applied to
   `stories.md`/the Story Tracker, re-announced, and GATE 1 is presented again
6. **PART 3 - Push to the configured tracker (only after GATE 1 approval)**: follow user-stories.md
   Steps 24–28
7. **MANDATORY**: Log the user's raw response in runtime-artifacts/audit.md

> **Next**: Proceed immediately to **Dependency Graph** stage to map dependencies between all stories.

## Dependency Graph (ALWAYS EXECUTE — immediately after User Stories)

**Purpose**: Analyse story dependencies. Each story gets a `requires` list; stories whose
prerequisites are all Done can be implemented in parallel. Produces `spec/plans/dependency-graph.yml`
and stamps `Requires` onto every story in the Story Tracker and `stories.md`.

🔴 **This stage is also the single commit point for `stories.md`, `personas.md` AND
`dependency-graph.yml`** — User Stories generates/pushes-to-tracker but does NOT commit; all three are
committed and pushed to the Epic branch together here, once, before Workflow Planning starts.

**Execution**:
1. **MANDATORY**: Log start of Dependency Graph stage in runtime-artifacts/audit.md
2. Load and execute all steps from `planning/dependency-graph-generation.md` — it defines the steps
   (reuse the fixed `team_size: 2` — NEVER ask it), the TRUE-PARALLELISM RULES for computing
   `requires`, the `dependency-graph.yml` schema and the **Story Tracker table format** (canonical
   columns: Requires, Tracker ID, Status, PR, Merged, Start, End, Recorded). **`requires` is INFERRED,
   never asked**
3. **AUTOMATIC — no gate**: announce the graph + ready-stories summary and PROCEED (enforced later by
   the Doability Gate and branch-cut merge check); a user correction is an interrupt. **MANDATORY**:
   log the graph, inferred edges and any correction
4. **MANDATORY — Epic Branch Commit & Push** (`planning/dependency-graph-generation.md` Step 9,
   automatic, no gate): commit `spec/plans/stories.md`, `spec/plans/personas.md`,
   `spec/plans/dependency-graph.yml`, `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` and
   `runtime-artifacts/audit.md` on the Epic branch (`AIRE-Version: [N]` trailer) and push to origin.
   No PR is raised here. Log the commit hash and push confirmation. If push fails, tell the user to
   push manually before proceeding.

---

## MANDATORY: Tracker Sync Rule (applies everywhere a story status changes)

Mechanics: `common/tracker-sync.md` Section 4. Whenever a story's status changes in the Story Tracker
(`runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`), dispatch on its **Tracker ID** column:

- **`—`/`LOCAL`** → local tracker only. No external action, ever.
- **A real JIRA/ADO/GITHUB id** → also transition the tracker issue, **confirm-first**
  (`Story 1.2 has Tracker ID PROJ-102. Transition to "[target status]"? (yes/skip)`). Yes: transition,
  verify, log. Skip: local only, note it.
- **EXCEPTION — `In Development` is automatic**: picking a story via `dev-implement` IS the claim.
  Update both sides without asking, verify, announce. Stays In Development through code generation,
  Code Review, Remediate, the PR raise and the auto PR review.

**🔷 Epic Status Sync** (skip silently when `Parent Epic: none` or `Type: LOCAL`):
- **First story starts** → also transition the Parent Epic to "In Development" — automatic, verified, announced, logged.
- **All stories done** (every PR merged, last story at `🧪 Ready for Testing`) → **confirm-first** to
  move the Epic to "Ready for Testing". If any PR is still open, do NOT move it — report the open PRs
  and keep everything In Development.

**Story↔Parent-Epic links** (User Stories Part 3) are **automatic, not confirm-first** — GATE 1 already
gave explicit approval — but still verified.

🔴 **NEVER** silently update only one side. Local and external trackers must stay in sync.

---

## Workflow Planning (ALWAYS EXECUTE)

1. **MANDATORY**: Log user input this phase in runtime-artifacts/audit.md
2. Load all steps from `planning/workflow-planning.md` and the content validation rules from
   `common/content-validation.md`; load all prior context (RE artifacts if brownfield, intent analysis,
   requirements if executed, user stories)
3. Execute: determine which phases run and at what depth, create the multi-package change sequence (if
   brownfield), generate the workflow visualization. **MANDATORY**: validate all content (Mermaid
   syntax included) before file creation, per content-validation.md
4. **AUTOMATIC — no gate**: present the plan per workflow-planning.md Step 9 (stages can be
   added/removed any time) and proceed; each selected stage keeps its own approval
5. **MANDATORY**: Log the finalized plan and any user change in runtime-artifacts/audit.md

## Application Design (CONDITIONAL)

**Execute IF**: new components/services needed · component methods or business rules need definition
· service layer design required · component dependencies need clarification

**Skip IF**: changes within existing component boundaries · no new components or methods · pure
implementation changes

**Execution**:
1. **MANDATORY**: Log user input this phase in runtime-artifacts/audit.md
2. Load all steps from `planning/application-design.md` and the RE artifacts (if brownfield); execute
   at the appropriate depth (minimal/standard/comprehensive)
3. **Wait for Explicit Approval**: present the detailed completion message (format in
   application-design.md) — DO NOT PROCEED until the user confirms. **MANDATORY**: log their raw response

## Transition to IMPLEMENTATION PHASE

After Application Design is approved (or Workflow Planning when it's skipped), proceed directly to the
**IMPLEMENTATION PHASE**. Its design stages run **once at system level**, scoped to the **intake
brief** at `spec/plans/epic-brief.md` (written from the configured tracker's Epic, or from the user's
requirements/natural-language description). Log the transition.

---

# 🟢 IMPLEMENTATION PHASE

**Purpose**: Detailed design, NFR implementation and code generation. **Focus**: HOW to build it.

**Stages**:

1. **System-Level DESIGN Stages** (single pass, scoped to the intake brief; **no code generated here**)
   — Functional Design · NFR Requirements · NFR Design · Infrastructure Design (each CONDITIONAL).
2. **`architecture.md` + Architecture Rubric** (ALWAYS — at the STOP CHECKPOINT, automatic, no gate):
   the design stages consolidate into `spec/plans/architecture.md`; its Section 10 Verifiable
   Constraints mechanically derive `tests/.evals/rubrics/architecture-rubric.json` (the **blocking** J1
   gate). **+ CI Pipeline (CONDITIONAL on the `## CI/CD Configuration` opt-in, Step 1.2 below)**: when
   enabled, this project's own `.github/workflows/agentic-eval-pipeline.yml` is generated from the
   repo's real stack/thresholds; when the user opts out, no CI file is generated and the implement
   runs go straight from the local gates + automated code review to the PR raise and auto PR review.
3. **Behaviour Specs & Test Plans** (ALWAYS — at the STOP CHECKPOINT, Step 1.7, ONE approval gate):
   `implementation/specs-and-test-plans.md`. EVERY work unit gets its Gherkin contract
   (`spec/behavior/<unit>.feature`) **and** its manual test plan (`spec/test-plans/<TICKET-ID>-<title>/`,
   via the `ve-implement` skill in WORKFLOW MODE) **before any code is generated**, reviewed in one
   pass like every other design artifact. The implement workflows then READ them — never author them.
4. **MANDATORY STOP** — the workflow HALTS and waits. Code Generation NEVER starts on its own.
5. **Development Handoff** — announce the ready stories; the user drives each one with **`dev-implement`**.
6. **Code Generation** (per-**story**, via the **`dev-implement`** keyword only) — full definition in
   `workflows/dev-implement.md`. In order:
   - **Story Selection** from the Dependency Graph, with a **Doability Gate** that never merges a
     prerequisite PR itself — even an approved one; merging stays a manual user action.
   - **Story branch** cut from the Epic branch (`common/branching-strategy.md`), then D1–D7 +
     regression **baseline** capture.
   - **Behaviour spec + test plan READ, never authored here** — `spec/behavior/story-<N.M>.feature`
     and `spec/test-plans/<TICKET-ID>-<title>/` were written and approved at the STOP CHECKPOINT
     (`implementation/specs-and-test-plans.md`). The run verifies them and backfills only a genuinely
     absent one, announced. 🔴 Never rewrite a scenario to match the code.
   - **Code generation** into **`src/`**, tests into `tests/`.
   - **Gates, in sequence**: unit + coverage → Gherkin in Podman (**B1** this unit → **B2** every
     other feature file → **B3** whole cycle, last unit only) → API & contract (when touching an API
     layer) → full regression vs baseline → static D1–D7 → automated Code Review including the
     diff-scoped Security Baseline review and **blocking** J1/J2 judge gates.
   - **Every self-healing loop is capped at 3 attempts**; on exhaustion HALTS with the Retry-Limit
     Report rather than proceeding.
   - On a clean verdict: commit, push, PR, auto PR review. Stays `🔵 In Development` until its PR
     **merges** and ve signs it off.
   - **Fully automatic — naming the story is the only user input.** Plan announced (no GATE 2), review
     routes on its own verdict (no GATE 3), findings auto-remediated and re-reviewed until clean.
7. **Code Review & Remediate** — `workflows/code-review.md` and `workflows/remediate.md`. Every review
   checks the acceptance criteria/requirements **and** the always-mandatory Security Baseline via a
   diff-scoped automated security review (`agents/code-security-review-agent.md` Phase 2.5), whose
   🔴/🟠 findings on the changed surface become real `SEC-ISS-XXX` findings, and computes the
   **blocking** J1/J2 gates. Both run automatically inside every implement workflow and are also
   invokable standalone, confirm-first.

**🧪 Test plans are AUTHORED here** (Step 1.7, every work unit, before code) but **EXECUTED** by ve
per story via `/ve-implement` after the story's PR merges.

---

## System-Level DESIGN Stages (Single Pass)

**These DESIGN stages execute in sequence, ONCE for the whole system, scoped to the intake brief
captured at workflow start. Code Generation is NOT part of them** — it happens later, per-story, via
`dev-implement`, after the STOP CHECKPOINT.

**Primary inputs for EVERY design stage**: `epic-brief.md` (defines WHAT to build) · `requirements.md`
· `stories.md` + `## Story Tracker` · Application Design artifacts if that stage ran · Atlas
existing-system truth when the Helix MCP is bound — on brownfield the existing architecture is the
**starting state**, and the design records the delta from it.

### The stages

| Stage | Rule file | Execute IF | Skip IF |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Functional Design** | `implementation/functional-design.md` | New data models/schemas · complex business logic · business rules need detailed design | Simple logic changes · no new business logic |
| **NFR Requirements** | `implementation/nfr-requirements.md` | Performance/security/scalability considerations · tech stack selection required | No NFR requirements · stack determined |
| **NFR Design** | `implementation/nfr-design.md` | NFR Requirements executed · patterns to incorporate | No NFR requirements · NFR Requirements skipped |
| **Infrastructure Design** | `implementation/infrastructure-design.md` | Infra services need mapping · deployment/cloud resources required | No infra changes · already defined |

### Execution pattern — IDENTICAL for all four stages

1. **MANDATORY**: Log user input this stage in runtime-artifacts/audit.md
2. Load all steps from the stage's rule file (table above) and execute it **for the whole system**
3. **MANDATORY**: Present the standardized **2-option** completion message from that stage's rule
   file — 🔴 DO NOT invent a 3-option menu or other navigation pattern
4. **Wait for Explicit Approval**: the user chooses "Request Changes" or "Continue to Next Stage" —
   DO NOT PROCEED until they confirm. **MANDATORY**: log their raw response

> **End of the System-Level DESIGN stages.** Once completed (or skipped), DO NOT generate code.
> Proceed to the mandatory STOP CHECKPOINT below.

---

## MANDATORY STOP — After Infrastructure Design, Before Code Generation

**This is a hard halt.** After design stages complete (Infrastructure Design done or skipped), the
workflow MUST stop and wait. **Code Generation MUST NOT start automatically.** Present the Development
Handoff below, then block until the user invokes `dev-implement`.

1. **MANDATORY**: Log reaching the stop CHECKPOINT.
1.2. **CI/CD Setup Opt-In (ASK-FIRST, CHAT-ONLY — same pattern as Tracker Selection)**: before loading
   `common/ci-pipeline-generation.md` or generating any CI/CD file. **Skip and reuse if
   `## CI/CD Configuration` already exists** in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` — never re-ask. If
   `.github/workflows/agentic-eval-pipeline.yml` already exists, do NOT ask: record `Enabled: Yes`
   `Source: pre-existing` and go to Step 1.6. Otherwise ask exactly
   `Set up the CI/CD eval pipeline for this project? (yes/no)` and record `Enabled: Yes|No` with
   `Source: user opt-in|user opt-out`, logging the question + raw answer in `runtime-artifacts/audit.md`.
   🔴 On **no**: **SKIP Steps 1.6 and 4 entirely** — never load `common/ci-pipeline-generation.md`, and
   never generate the pipeline, `sonar-project.properties`, or any `tests/.evals/scripts/*` CI script.
1.3. **WRITE `spec/behavior.feature`** (automatic, no gate) per `common/behavior-spec.md` Section 3 —
   the cross-story journeys that belong to no single story, `@REQ-<id>` tagged, written ONCE per cycle;
   what the **B3 tier** runs on the last work unit. 🔴 Genuine cross-unit journeys only, never copies of
   per-story scenarios; if none exist, record that explicitly.
1.4. **WRITE `spec/plans/architecture.md`** (MANDATORY, automatic, no gate) per
   `implementation/architecture-doc.md` — **assembled from the approved design artifacts and Atlas
   truth, never authored fresh**; a skipped stage says so explicitly rather than being filled with an
   invented decision. 🔴 **Before the design commit**, assert both ALWAYS inline Mermaid diagrams
   (Section 2.1 — System Context + Component Architecture, plus an `erDiagram` when a store/schema
   changed) and **Section 10 Verifiable Constraints** (3–8 entries, weights summing to 1.0) are present
   and valid per `common/content-validation.md`; missing/unparseable → fix before committing.
   Section 10 is what makes the blocking J1 gate fair. Version it and log it.
1.5. **Derive the rubrics** (automatic, no gate) per `implementation/architecture-doc.md` Section 4 and
   `common/eval-framework.md` Section 3: `tests/.evals/rubrics/architecture-rubric.json` **mechanically
   from `architecture.md` Section 10** (`rubricVersion` **equal to** the `architecture.md` version),
   plus `security-rubric.json` and `tests/.evals/config.json` when absent. 🔴 **Artifact Ownership
   (`common/directory-structure.md`) — create if missing, never regenerate**: deterministically, on the
   cycle branch; never push to base, never raise a `[CI]` PR, never halt because base wasn't
   bootstrapped. 🔴 **Never hand-write or hand-edit a rubric** — edit Section 10 and regenerate. Nothing
   derivable → Section 3 fallback chain, J1 recorded `N/A` (never blocks). Log it.
1.6. **Generate the CI pipeline** (CONDITIONAL on Step 1.2 `Enabled: Yes`) per
   `common/ci-pipeline-generation.md` — built for THIS project from its own build files and the
   `tests/.evals/config.json` thresholds, **validated before committing** (Section 4.0), committed **on
   the cycle branch** (Section 2.1, never pushed to base, never a separate `[CI]` PR), idempotent, plus
   the generated `tests/.evals/scripts/*`. Its **SonarQube setup gate (Section 4.1.2) is the ONE
   sanctioned halt inside CI generation** — emit it verbatim and HALT for `proceed`/`skip`. 🔴 Never
   write a token into any file. 🔴 CI **re-verifies** the local gates, never relaxes them.
1.7. **WRITE EVERY WORK UNIT'S BEHAVIOUR SPEC + MANUAL TEST PLAN** (MANDATORY, ONE approval gate) per
   `implementation/specs-and-test-plans.md` — the LAST design artifacts, written before any code
   exists. For **every** story in the `## Story Tracker` (bug/enhancement cycles: the single ticket):
   (a) `spec/behavior/<unit>.feature` per `common/behavior-spec.md` Section 2 — one `@AC-<n>`-tagged
   scenario per acceptance criterion, failure paths included; (b) `spec/test-plans/<TICKET-ID>-<title>/`
   by **invoking the `ve-implement` skill in WORKFLOW MODE** (never re-implemented; no `ve/…` branch,
   no PR — the files ride this checkpoint's own commit). Run the blocking coverage check (every AC has
   ≥1 scenario AND ≥1 test case), then present the standardized **2-option** completion message and
   **WAIT** for `Request Changes` / `Continue to Next Stage`; log the prompt and complete raw response.
   🔴 Scope derivation, NOT ve sign-off — ve still runs `/ve-implement` and `ve-list-work` separately.
2. Mark in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`: `Design complete — awaiting dev-implement`.
3. **Commit + push the design artifacts on the Epic branch (automatic — unblocks ve)**: stage
   `spec/**` (Step 1.3's `behavior.feature`, Step 1.4's `architecture.md`, and Step 1.7's
   `behavior/` + `test-plans/`), `tests/.evals/**` (Step 1.5's files, plus Step 1.6's when it ran),
   `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`, `runtime-artifacts/audit.md`. Commit with an `AIRE-Version: [N]`
   trailer and push. If push fails, tell the user to push manually — **ve cannot start until this
   branch is on origin**.
4. **🧪 Epic-level pre-handoff smoke test** (CONDITIONAL on `Enabled: Yes` — SKIPPED entirely, and
   announced, when `Enabled: No`; automatic, HARD HALT on exhaustion) per
   `common/ci-pipeline-generation.md` Section 4.0.6: run `tests/.evals/scripts/smoke-test-epic.{sh,ps1}`
   against the epic branch just pushed. It proves the environment is viable to build on, not that the
   pipeline's delta-scoped logic is correct. On exhaustion the scratch PR stays open and
   **Development Handoff does NOT happen** until resolved.
5. Present the **Development Handoff** message (below).
6. **HALT.** Do not proceed to Code Generation or any later stage until the user types `dev-implement`

## Development Handoff — Use `dev-implement` to Build Each Story

At Step 5 above, load `common/development-handoff.md` and emit its message **verbatim** — that file
carries the template and substitution rules. Never ship an unsubstituted placeholder. Log the handoff,
then **HALT**.

---

## Code Generation (per-story, ONLY when the user types `dev-implement`)

**On the `dev-implement` keyword, read `workflows/dev-implement.md` and follow it exactly.**

---

## Code Review & Remediate

**Status**: OPTIONAL standalone invocations, for **one story** or **all stories together**. Both also
run automatically inside every implement workflow; this section covers standalone use.

- **`code-review`** → read `workflows/code-review.md` and follow it exactly (REVIEWER, read-only).
- **`remediate`** → read `workflows/remediate.md` and follow it exactly (DEV, code-editing).

🔴 **NEVER auto-run them here** — standalone invocations are user-initiated. After a story's PR is
raised, *suggest* both as optional next steps without running either. Log every response and tracker update.

---

# TICKET WORKFLOW (keyword: `ticket-implement <TICKET-ID>` — Bug OR Enhancement)

**On `ticket-implement <TICKET-ID>`** (existing ticket in the configured tracker; omit the ID for
LOCAL and describe the item inline): read `workflows/ticket-implement.md` and follow it exactly.

---

## Key Principles

- **Adaptive Execution** — run only the stages that add value; complex changes get full treatment,
  simple changes stay efficient.
- **Transparent Planning** — always show the execution plan first; the user may add or remove stages
  any time.
- **Progress Tracking** — record executed and skipped stages in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`.
- **Complete Audit Trail** — every interaction logged with complete raw input, not just approvals.
- **Content Validation** — validate all content before file creation (`common/content-validation.md`).
- **Bounded Self-Healing** — every automatic fix loop is capped at **3 attempts**; on exhaustion the
  run HALTS at that gate with the Retry-Limit Report and asks the user for next steps. A failing gate
  is never skipped, weakened or carried forward. 🔴 **One named exception**: the epic-level smoke
  test's watch loop (`common/ci-pipeline-generation.md` Section 4.0.6) is UNBOUNDED, terminating only
  via `auto-fix-agent.*`'s own `retryLimitForSelfRepair` exhaustion or a genuine fix — never license
  to uncap any OTHER loop.
- 🔴 **NO EMERGENT BEHAVIOR** — Implementation-phase design stages MUST use the standardized
  **2-option** completion message from their own rule file. Never invent a 3-option menu or other pattern.

## MANDATORY: Plan-Level Checkbox Enforcement

**NEVER complete work without updating the plan checkboxes.** Immediately after finishing ANY step in
a plan file, mark it `[x]` — in the **SAME interaction** where the work completed. No exceptions. Two
levels: plan-level tracks progress within a stage, stage-level tracks overall progress in
`runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`; both update in the same interaction as the work.

## Prompts Logging Requirements
Same non-negotiables as the Audit Trail section above, applied to EVERY user input and AI response.
Implementation-flow entries also add `**TRACKER ITEM**:`, `**Epic Link**:` and `**AIRE VERSION**:`;
self-healing entries add `**SH-LOOP**:`, `**Root cause**:` and `**Verification**:`.

## Directory Structure

**CRITICAL RULE — five roots, nothing outside them**:
- **`src/`** — ALL application code, greenfield AND brownfield. If a brownfield repo keeps code
  elsewhere, record that root ONCE as `## Code Root` in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` and treat it
  as `src/`. 🔴 Never a second code location; never mass-move an existing tree.
- **`tests/`** — `unit/`, `behavior/` (Gherkin step definitions), `e2e/` (Playwright)
- **`spec/`** — specs/docs ONLY, 🔴 never a source file. `behavior.feature` at its root (**once per
  cycle, never per story**) plus four subfolders: **`plans/`** — flat planning/design docs
  (`architecture.md`, `atlas-deep-dive.md` + the flat RE docs, `requirements.md`, `stories.md`,
  `personas.md`, `epic-brief.md`, `dependency-graph.yml`, the design docs, and
  **`delta/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/`** written at cycle close by `archive-epic`); **`spec-generation/`** —
  the `*-generation.md` plan/question files; **`behavior/`** — one `.feature` per work unit;
  **`test-plans/`** — the manual test plans. Those last two are written at the STOP CHECKPOINT
  (Step 1.7). Plus human-authored **`context-project/`** (`existing-knowledge/`, `new-references/`;
  read only at a user-supplied path, never auto-scanned).
  🔴 **`spec/` is cycle-scoped**: `archive-epic` snapshots the whole tree into
  `aire-archives/<type>/<ID>-<slug>/` and **removes it in full**, `context-project/` included; after
  the cycle PR merges, `stitch-delta` reads that delta out of the archive and refreshes the **whole**
  Atlas deep dive against the merged code. Base carries no `spec/` between cycles.
- **`reports/`** — generated OUTPUTS ONLY: `unit-test-evidence/`, `behavior-test-evidence/`,
  `api-contract-test-evidence/`, `eval-evidence/`, `reviews/`, `code-security-reviews/`,
  `ticket-summary/`. 🔴 `.feature` contracts live in `spec/behavior/`, never here.
- **`tests/.evals/`** — `config.json`, `rubrics/`, `scripts/`
- CONDITIONAL on the `## CI/CD Configuration` opt-in:
  **`.github/workflows/agentic-eval-pipeline.yml`** (`common/ci-pipeline-generation.md`) — absent
  entirely when the user opted out
- Structure inside `src/`: see `implementation/code-generation.md` for patterns by project type

**Full canonical layout**: `common/directory-structure.md` — load on demand to place an artifact whose
path isn't already fixed by the rule file you're following.

# Archive Epic Agent — Close a Release Cycle (Epic, Bug, or Enhancement)

## Bug /  Enhancement Mode (read this first)

This agent closes **epic cycles**, **bug cycles** (`Workflow Type: bug` in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` `## Tracker`, produced by `bug-fix`/`bug-fix-implement`), AND **enhancement cycles** (`Workflow Type: enhancement`, produced by `enhancement-implement`). The steps below are written in epic terms; in **bug or enhancement mode** apply these substitutions everywhere:
- **Cycle ID** = the ticket key (`Parent Ticket`, e.g. `PROJ-123`); **cycle name** = the ticket title. Wherever the steps say `<EPIC-ID>`/`<epic-name-slug>`, use the ticket ID and its slug.
- **Archive path**: epic cycles archive to **`aire-archives/epics/<EPIC-ID>-<epic-name-slug>/`**; bug cycles to **`aire-archives/bugs/<BUG-ID>-<ticket-name-slug>/`**; enhancement cycles to **`aire-archives/enhancements/<ENH-ID>-<ticket-name-slug>/`**. Wherever the steps say `aire-archives/<EPIC-ID>-<epic-name-slug>/`, read the type-appropriate subfolder path. Never write archives directly under `aire-archives/` — always inside `epics/`, `bugs/`, or `enhancements/`.
- **Invocation mode**: **epic mode is the ONLY auto-triggered mode** — pr-generator invokes it on an Epic → Base PR. 🔴 **Bug and enhancement cycles are ALWAYS operator-invoked (manual)**: `bug-fix-implement` (Step 12) and `enhancement-implement` (Step 19) deliberately do NOT invoke this skill, and pr-generator's Phase 7 auto-trigger explicitly excludes `[BUG]`/`[ENH]` → Base PRs. The invocation mode changes **who starts the run and which readiness checks apply** — it does NOT change Step 6 or Step 6.5, which are automatic in every mode.
  - **Why bug/enhancement archives are manual**: ve work lands on the cycle branch on its own schedule and is not synchronised with the `[BUG]`/`[ENH]` PR — `/ve-implement` writes `spec/test-plans/<TICKET-ID>-<title>/` on its own `ve/...` branch + PR (possibly raised *after* the fix is done), and `ve-list-work` Option C amends an existing test plan later still. Because this skill takes a ONE-SHOT destructive snapshot and then resets the live docs, an archive taken automatically at PR time would silently omit `tests/` or miss later test-plan edits, and nothing would ever re-capture them. The operator archives once everything has landed — see Step 2's ve readiness check.
- **Release Readiness (Step 2) in bug/enhancement mode**: ve signs off **on the cycle branch, before this archive** (`ve-list-work` Option B). 🔴 **The cycle closes on BOTH sign-off outcomes** — approve and reject alike — so the ticket's status is NOT a pass/fail criterion here. What matters is only that the sign-off **happened**:
  - **Ticket `🧪 Ready for Testing`** → ve approved. Archive normally, no warning.
  - **Ticket `🔵 In Development` AND the ticket carries the `ve-rejected` label (or runtime-artifacts/audit.md records an Option B rejection for it)** → ve rejected. This is a **legitimate, expected cycle close, NOT a gap**: the rejection is a completed decision, the follow-up defect is tracked as its own ticket via `/raise-defect`, and this cycle's record (including the rejection) must be archived. Archive normally — **do NOT warn, do NOT recommend re-running `ve-list-work`, and do NOT ask "archive anyway?"**. Note in runtime-artifacts/audit.md and in `archive-manifest.md` that the cycle closed on an ve rejection, naming the follow-up defect key if one is recorded.
  - **Ticket `🔵 In Development` with NO rejection evidence** → sign-off genuinely has not run yet. Only here: warn and ask whether to archive anyway (recommend: no — run `ve-list-work` Option B on this branch first, so the decision is captured in the archive).
  - ALSO verify the `[BUG]` / `[ENH]` PR has been **raised and is still open** (`Bug PR` / `Enhancement PR` in `## Branching`) — it must NOT be merged yet, because this skill's cycle-close commit has to ride it to the base branch. If the PR is already merged, warn loudly: the cycle-close commit will not reach the base branch.

You are a **release manager** closing a release cycle. You will:
1. **Generate the cycle's reverse-engineering delta** into `spec/plans/delta/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/` — the
   change record: what this cycle actually changed about the system, with a path-level evidence table
   and the problems it resolved (Step 3)
2. **Archive** the complete `spec/` (the delta included) + `reports/` + the root `runtime-artifacts/`
   state files (`audit.md`, `aire-state.md`) into a cycle-named archive folder
3. **Delete the live `spec/`, `reports/` and `runtime-artifacts/` trees entirely** — the archive is now
   the only copy, and it is the copy everything downstream reads

🔴 **This skill generates the delta and archives it; it NEVER publishes anything.** Refreshing the
**deep dive document on Atlas via the Helix MCP** belongs to the **`stitch-delta`** skill
(`agents/stitch-delta-agent.md`), which runs **on the base branch after this cycle's PR has merged**,
reads this delta **out of the archive this skill just created**, and refreshes the deep dive against the
**merged code** — every section, not only the areas this delta names.

That split is what makes the whole flow conflict-free. Because `spec/` is deleted here, in the cycle's
own PR, base carries no `spec/` between cycles: the next cycle inherits nothing, rebuilds `spec/` from
Atlas truth, and contributes back only **additions** under its own unique
`aire-archives/<type>/<ID>-<slug>/` path. 🔴 **Do not "helpfully" leave `atlas-deep-dive.md` or
`spec/plans/delta/` behind for the stitch** — an earlier design did exactly that, and that shared,
per-cycle-rewritten file on base was the only genuine merge collision this flow ever had. The delta in
the archive is what the stitch reads.

**Where this skill stops to ask, and where it does not.** The gates are all **upstream**, about whether the cycle is ready to be captured: Step 2 (stories not yet Ready for Testing), Step 2.5 (ve artifacts missing or an ve PR still open), Step 2.6 (the typed `proceed` on bug/enhancement cycles) and Step 5's same-name archive collision. 🔴 **Everything downstream of a verified archive is AUTOMATIC and asks nothing** — the removal of the live trees (Step 6), the commit, the push and the PR (Step 6.5). The archive's byte-for-byte verification IS the safety gate; a confirmation prompt on top of a proven copy adds no safety and stalls the close. NEVER delete anything before the archive copy is verified.

## Step 0: Load the Source Rules

**MANDATORY**: Read and load `common/content-validation.md` (content validation for any generated documents).

---

## Step 1: Preconditions & Epic Identification

1. Verify `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` exists. If not, STOP: tell the user there is no active AIRE project to archive.
2. Resolve the **cycle type and ID**:
   - Read `## Tracker` in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`. `Workflow Type: bug` → **bug mode**; `Workflow Type: enhancement` → **enhancement mode** (both: Cycle ID = `Parent Ticket`, name from the ticket title / `spec/plans/bug-brief.md` / `spec/plans/enhancement-brief.md`); otherwise **epic mode** (Cycle ID = `Parent Epic`, name from `epic-brief.md`).
   - Fallback: ask the user:
     ```
      Which Epic, Bug, or Enhancement ticket does this release cycle belong to?
        Provide the ID and name (e.g., "PROJ-50, User Authentication",
        "PROJ-123, Login timeout (bug)" or "PROJ-456, Export to CSV (enhancement)").

     [Answer]:
     ```
3. Derive the archive folder: `aire-archives/epics/<EPIC-ID>-<epic-name-slug>/` (epic mode), `aire-archives/bugs/<BUG-ID>-<ticket-name-slug>/` (bug mode), or `aire-archives/enhancements/<ENH-ID>-<ticket-name-slug>/` (enhancement mode) — kebab-case the name (e.g., `PROJ-50-user-authentication`, `PROJ-456-export-to-csv`).
4. **MANDATORY**: Log the invocation in `runtime-artifacts/audit.md` (append-only, complete raw input).

---

## Step 2: Release Readiness Check

Read the `## Story Tracker` in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`:
- 🔴 **First apply the bug/enhancement exception above**: a bug/enhancement ticket left `🔵 In Development` by an **ve rejection** (`ve-rejected` label / an Option B rejection in runtime-artifacts/audit.md) is a legitimate cycle close — treat that row as READY and skip the prompt below for it entirely. Never ask "archive anyway?" for a rejected ticket.
- Otherwise, if any story is NOT `🧪 Ready for Testing`, present the list of incomplete stories and ask:
  ```
   [N] stories are not yet Ready for Testing: [list with statuses]

  Archive anyway? (yes / no)
  ```
- Block until the user answers. Log the answer in runtime-artifacts/audit.md. On "no", STOP.

### Step 2.5: ve Artifact Readiness Check (🔴 MANDATORY — the archive is one-shot)

The archive is a ONE-SHOT snapshot: anything not in the working tree right now is lost from the cycle record, and the workspace reset means nothing re-captures it later. Before archiving, verify the ve's work has actually landed on this branch. **Never skip this check, in any mode** (it is the reason bug/enhancement archives are manual).

1. **Pull the branch first**: confirm the current branch is the cycle branch and is up to date with origin (`git fetch origin && git status -sb`). If it is behind, run automatic `git pull --ff-only`.
2. **Check for the expected test docs**: for every ticket/story in scope, look for `spec/test-plans/<TICKET-ID>-<title>/`. Also check for un-merged ve branches/PRs targeting this cycle branch (`gh pr list --base <cycle-branch>` — look for `ve/...` heads).
3. If any expected test folder is **missing**, or an ve PR into this branch is still **open**, warn and ask — do NOT archive silently:
   ```
    ve artifacts look incomplete for this cycle:
      • Missing spec/test-plans/ folder for: [list of tickets/stories]
      • Open ve PR(s) into <cycle-branch> not yet merged: [list with URLs]

   Archiving now permanently omits these from the archive — the archive is one-shot and the
   workspace reset that follows leaves nothing to re-capture. Recommended: merge the ve PR(s),
   `git pull --ff-only` on <cycle-branch>, then re-run archive-epic.

   Archive anyway? (yes — archive incomplete / no — stop so I can merge the ve work)
   ```
   Block until answered. On **no**, STOP (nothing written). On **yes**, proceed and record the omission explicitly in runtime-artifacts/audit.md AND in the Step 5.4 `archive-manifest.md` as a `**Known Gaps**:` line naming exactly what was missing.
4. Log the check — folders found, PRs inspected, and the user's raw answer — in runtime-artifacts/audit.md.

### Step 2.6:  ve COMPLETION Checkpoint — bug & enhancement cycles ONLY (typed `proceed` required)

🔴 **In bug or enhancement mode this checkpoint is MANDATORY and ALWAYS runs**, even if Step 2.5 found no problems and even if the user just typed `archive-epic` deliberately. It exists because those cycles are archived manually precisely so the operator can confirm ve is finished. **Skip this checkpoint in epic mode only** (epic cycles complete ve sign-off on the epic branch before the Epic PR).

Present this message VERBATIM (substituting real values) and then **HALT — do not read, write, copy, or delete anything until the user replies**:

```
 Before I archive this [bug | enhancement] cycle — has ALL the ve work for [TICKET-ID]
   been MERGED and COMPLETED on `<cycle-branch>`

    NOT complete → do NOT proceed. Merge/finish the outstanding ve work into
      `<cycle-branch>`, then `git pull --ff-only` on it, then run `archive-epic` again.
    Complete     → type **proceed**

[Answer]:
```

**Rules for this checkpoint**:
- 🔴 **An ve REJECTION counts as COMPLETE.** "Completed" means the ve's test plan is merged and their Option B **decision has been made** — approve *or* reject. A rejected ticket (still `🔵 In Development`, carrying `ve-rejected`) closes its cycle exactly like an approved one, so never treat a rejection as outstanding work, never push the user back to `ve-list-work` over it, and never imply the archive should wait.
- **Only  `proceed`**opens the checkpoint. Anything else — "yes", "ok", "go ahead", silence, a question — is NOT consent: restate the checkpoint once and keep waiting. Never infer consent from the fact that the user invoked the skill.
- On anything indicating incompleteness, **STOP the whole skill** with nothing written, and tell the user exactly what to merge first.
- Log the checkpoint prompt and the user's complete raw answer in runtime-artifacts/audit.md before continuing.

---

## Step 3: Generate the Reverse-Engineering Delta (MANDATORY — before the archive copy)

🔴 **This step is the single source of truth for the delta format.** `stitch-delta`
(`agents/stitch-delta-agent.md`) reads this schema to apply the delta — locally and to Atlas. Never
change the shape here without updating that agent.

**Runs AFTER the readiness checks and BEFORE the Step 5 archive copy**, so the delta is itself
captured in the archive.

**Output**: `spec/plans/delta/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/delta.md` — same `<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>` as the archive
folder (`PROJ-50-payment-portal`, `PROJ-123-login-timeout`, …). One folder per cycle, so several
pending deltas from parallel cycles never collide.

### 3.1 Inputs — what the delta is derived FROM

Read all of these; the delta is assembled from them, never invented:

| Input | Contributes |
|---|---|
| `spec/plans/atlas-deep-dive.md` | The deep dive as it stands, so the delta can name areas and resolved findings **the way the document names them**. 🔴 It is NOT a patch target — `stitch-delta` refreshes it from the merged code. |
| `spec/plans/architecture.md` — especially **Section 9 Delta from the Existing System** and Section 2 Component Inventory | The intended change, already approved |
| `git diff --name-status <cycle-base-sha>...HEAD` and `git log --oneline <cycle-base-sha>..HEAD` | What actually shipped — the **commit range** recorded in the ledger |
| `reports/ticket-summary/` | Per-work-unit summaries of what each story/fix changed |
| `spec/plans/requirements.md`, `stories.md` | Why it changed — the Summary's narrative |

🔴 **Describe what MERGED, not what was planned.** Where `architecture.md` and the real diff disagree,
the diff wins and the discrepancy is noted in the delta's Notes section.

### 3.2 `delta.md` — required structure

The delta is the cycle's **change record**: what shipped, with evidence, and why. 🔴 It is **not** a
patch script for the deep dive — `stitch-delta` derives the document's new content from the **merged
code**, using this file for the narrative, the traceability and as a hint about which areas moved.

````markdown
# RE Delta — <CYCLE-ID> <cycle name>

> **Cycle**: <epic | bug | enhancement> · <CYCLE-ID>
> **Branch**: <cycle branch> → <base branch>
> **Commit range**: <base-sha>..<head-sha>
> **Generated**: <ISO 8601, from a real clock>
> **AIRE**: v<N>

## Summary
<3–6 lines: what this cycle changed about the SYSTEM — components, contracts, data, dependencies,
 structure. Not a changelog of stories.>

## Changed Surfaces
<The evidence table. One row per real change, each with a path a reader can open.>

| Surface | Change | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `src/organization/` | new module — org hierarchy CRUD + membership | `src/organization/` (14 files) |
| `src/team/`, `src/admin/` | new modules | `src/team/`, `src/admin/` |
| `scripts/seed.ts` | new dev seeding script | `scripts/seed.ts` |
| POST /orgs/{id}/members | new endpoint | `src/organization/routes.ts:88` |
| `organizations`, `org_members` | new tables + FKs | `migrations/0007_org.sql` |
| `@casl/ability` | new dependency (authz) | `package.json` |

## Impacted Deep-Dive Areas
<🔴 A HINT, explicitly NON-EXHAUSTIVE. Name the deep-dive areas this cycle plainly affects, so the
 refresh has a starting point. `stitch-delta` still checks EVERY section against the code and is
 never limited to this list — an area missing here is a hint that was not written, never permission
 to leave a section stale.>

- Directory Structure · Comprehensive Statistics · Entry Points · Component Catalog
- Internal Dependencies + Coupling · Database Analysis · Test Coverage
- Security → Authorization · Appendix A (File Inventory) · Appendix B (Dependency List)

## Resolved
<Anything the deep dive currently records as a problem that this cycle FIXED — an anti-pattern, a
 debt item, an open recommendation, a security finding. Name it as the document names it, so the
 refresh can strike or update it rather than leaving a resolved issue on the record.>

| Recorded as | Section | How this cycle resolved it |
|---|---|---|
| "No role model — every authenticated user is an admin" | Security → Authorization | RBAC via `@casl/ability`, enforced in `src/admin/guard.ts` |

## Notes
<Anything a human must know: plan-vs-shipped discrepancies, a capability shipped behind a flag, a
 change deliberately NOT reflected in the system's public behaviour.>
````

### 3.3 Content rules

- 🔴 **Describe what MERGED, not what was planned.** Where `architecture.md` and the real diff disagree,
  the diff wins and the discrepancy goes in Notes.
- **Every Changed Surfaces row cites a real path** — a file, directory or `file:line` a reader can open.
  A row without evidence is a claim, and the refresh cannot verify a claim.
- **`Impacted Deep-Dive Areas` is a hint, never a contract.** Write it to help, not to bound. 🔴 Never
  phrase it as "the sections to update" — that framing is exactly what once left `### Directory
  Structure` describing a codebase that no longer existed.
- **`Resolved` is what makes the document stop carrying fixed problems.** A deep dive that still lists a
  resolved anti-pattern is as wrong as one missing a new module; this table is the only place the cycle
  can say "this is no longer true".
- 🔴 **No anchors, no find/replace payloads, no directive ordering.** Earlier versions of this schema
  carried literal `old_string`/`new_string` pairs against the deep dive; that made the delta a fragile
  patch whose coverage silently became the document's accuracy ceiling. The refresh reads the code.

### 3.4 When the cycle changed nothing describable

A cycle that changed no externally describable system surface (a docs-only fix, a test-only change)
still gets a `delta.md` — with a Summary saying so and an explicitly empty Changed Surfaces table:

```markdown
## Changed Surfaces
None — this cycle changed no component, contract, data model, dependency or structure described by the
deep dive.
```

🔴 Never skip the file. `stitch-delta` still ledgers it (and still re-verifies the document against the
code, which is how drift from any source gets caught).
### 3.5 🔴 Do NOT touch the stitch ledger

`aire-archives/stitch-ledger.md` is **written only by `stitch-delta`**, and only after a delta's Atlas
write has verified. This skill writes **no row of any kind** — not a pending one, not a placeholder.

**A delta is pending precisely because it has no ledger row.** Absence is the signal. That is what keeps
the ledger strictly append-only. A pending row that a later run had to *edit into* a stitched row would
turn a one-line append into a read-modify-write on a shared file — reintroducing exactly the collision
this design removes. (`stitch-delta` additionally refuses to start while a stitch PR is open, so the
ledger is only ever written by one run at a time.)

### 3.6 Verify and log

- Validate `delta.md` per `common/content-validation.md`.
- Confirm every Changed Surfaces row cites a path that actually exists in the merged tree — a claim with
  no evidence is fixed **now**, not discovered by `stitch-delta` on base.
- Announce: the delta path, the Changed Surfaces count, and the commit range.
- Log all of it in `runtime-artifacts/audit.md` (still live at this point).

## Step 5: Create the Epic Archive

🔴 **Path rule for this step and every step after it**: wherever the text below writes a shorthand archive path like `aire-archives/<EPIC-ID>-<epic-name-slug>/`, the REAL path ALWAYS includes the cycle-type subfolder resolved in Step 1.3 — `aire-archives/epics/<EPIC-ID>-<slug>/`, `aire-archives/bugs/<BUG-ID>-<slug>/`, or `aire-archives/enhancements/<ENH-ID>-<slug>/`. Nothing is ever written directly under `aire-archives/`.

1. Append a final audit entry to `runtime-artifacts/audit.md` recording the archive event (epic, timestamp, archive path) — do this BEFORE copying, so the archive carries the complete trail.
2. Create the archive folder resolved in Step 1.3 — `aire-archives/epics/<EPIC-ID>-<epic-name-slug>/`, `aire-archives/bugs/<BUG-ID>-<slug>/`, or `aire-archives/enhancements/<ENH-ID>-<slug>/` — at the workspace root (create the `epics/`/`bugs/`/`enhancements/` subfolder if missing).
   - **If `aire-archives/` (or its subfolders) already exist**: reuse them as-is. NEVER recreate them, and NEVER touch, replace, or delete any OTHER cycle folder inside them — only the folder for THIS cycle is ever written.
   - **If a folder with this exact epic name already exists** inside `aire-archives/`, do NOT silently overwrite — ask:
     ```
      Archive folder aire-archives/<EPIC-ID>-<epic-name-slug>/ already exists.

     Replace it with a fresh archive from this run? (yes / no)
     ```
     - On **yes**: delete only that same-name epic folder and recreate it fresh from this run's `spec/`. All other epic folders remain untouched.
     - On **no**: STOP the archive step — do not write anything into `aire-archives/`. Log the decision in runtime-artifacts/audit.md.
   - Log the collision check and the user's raw answer in runtime-artifacts/audit.md.
3. 🔴 **Copy the live `spec/` tree, the live `reports/` tree, AND the root `runtime-artifacts/` folder into the archive, each as ONE folder.** The archive is an exact mirror — three copy commands, no unpacking, no per-folder logic, no exclusions:
   ```bash
   ARCH="aire-archives/epics/<EPIC-ID>-<epic-name-slug>"   # or bugs/ | enhancements/
   mkdir -p "$ARCH"
   cp -R spec "$ARCH/spec"
   [ -d reports ] && cp -R reports "$ARCH/reports"                       # generated outputs — mirror if present
   [ -d runtime-artifacts ] && cp -R runtime-artifacts "$ARCH/runtime-artifacts"  # audit.md + aire-state.md
   ```
   Those copies carry **everything** the cycle was built from and produced:
   - `spec/` — `architecture.md` (`spec/plans/architecture.md`) and all flat docs under `spec/plans/` (requirements, stories, personas, the design docs, `dependency-graph.yml`, `atlas-deep-dive.md` and the flat RE docs), **`spec/plans/delta/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/` (this cycle's Step 3 delta)**, `spec/spec-generation/`, `spec/behavior/`, `spec/test-plans/`
   - `spec/behavior/` — one `.feature` file per work unit: the Gherkin contract the code was built against
   - `reports/` — the generated outputs: `unit-test-evidence/`, `behavior-test-evidence/`, `api-contract-test-evidence/`, `eval-evidence/`, `reviews/`, `code-security-reviews/`, `ticket-summary/` (mirrored only when the live `reports/` folder exists)
   - `runtime-artifacts/` — the cycle's `audit.md` and `aire-state.md` (mirrored only when the live folder exists)
   - `spec/context-project/existing-knowledge/` and `spec/context-project/new-references/` — the human-authored inputs: the notes describing the existing system, and the wireframes/specs/mockups that defined the target

   🔴 **Mirror each exactly — same folder name, same structure, same depth.** The archive contains `spec/`, and (when present) `reports/` and `runtime-artifacts/`, not a renamed or unpacked copy. Use `ls -a` to inspect it. Keeping the names identical is what makes the copy verifiable with a single diff and the restore path unambiguous.

   The copy is ALWAYS unfiltered — there are NO exclusions.
   - **Size**: `new-references/` can hold large binaries (mockups, PDFs, videos). Record the archive's total byte size in the manifest so growth stays visible. Do **not** filter it — an incomplete reference set is worse than a large one.
   - 🔴 **GUARDRAIL — NEVER flatten**: do NOT copy any tree's *contents* into the archive folder root (never `cp -R spec/. "$ARCH/"` or `cp -R spec/* "$ARCH/"`). The archive folder must contain exactly `spec/`, `reports/` (when present), `runtime-artifacts/` (when present) and `archive-manifest.md` — never `requirements/`, `design/`, `aire-state.md` or `audit.md` sitting loose beside the manifest. Flattening instead of mirroring is the #1 cause of inconsistent archive layouts across cycles.
   - 🔴 **GUARDRAIL — ARCHIVE EVERYTHING, for EVERY cycle type**: a **complete, recursive, unfiltered** copy — every folder and every file at every depth, whatever it is named and whoever produced it. **The cycle type only changes the destination subfolder (`epics/` | `bugs/` | `enhancements/`), never WHAT gets copied**: a bug cycle archives the same full tree an epic cycle does. There are **NO exclusions** in this skill.
     - **NEVER** archive a hand-picked subset, whitelist, or "the folders this cycle touched".
     - **NEVER** skip a folder for looking empty, unused, stale, irrelevant to this cycle type, produced by another role (ve's `test-plans/`), or authored by a human rather than the framework (`existing-knowledge/`, `new-references/`). If it is inside `spec/`, it goes into the archive.
     - **NEVER** exclude dotfiles/dot-folders, hidden files, or files without a `.md` extension (logs, `.yml`, `.json`, coverage reports, images, binaries). Do not use extension- or name-based filters, and do not apply `.gitignore` rules — untracked and ignored files inside `spec/` are still archived. Use a plain recursive copy, never `git archive`, never a `find … -name '*.md'` loop.
     - **NEVER** move, delete, rewrite, truncate, reformat, summarize, or "tidy" anything while copying — the archive is a byte-for-byte snapshot, not a curated export.

4. Write `aire-archives/<type>/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/archive-manifest.md` (as a SIBLING of the `spec/` folder just created — NOT inside it):
   ```markdown
   # Cycle Archive Manifest
   - **Cycle**: [CYCLE-ID] — [Cycle name] ([epic | bug | enhancement])
   - **Archived**: [ISO timestamp]
   - **Stories**: [total] ([n] Ready for Testing, [n] other — list any incomplete)
   - **Analyzed At Commit**: [SHA]
   - **Archived Files**: [N] files, [total size] (complete recursive mirror of `spec/` + `reports/` + `runtime-artifacts/`; verified equal to the live trees)
   - **Contents**: spec/ docs · reports/ outputs [present/absent] · runtime-artifacts/ state [present/absent] · [N] work-unit bundles ([list slugs]) · context-project [present/absent] · new-references [present/absent, [size]]
   - **ve Artifacts**: [test folders present: list |  Known Gaps: <what was missing / which ve PR was still open> — user chose to archive anyway at Step 2.5]
   ```
5. **Verify the copy** — check BOTH of the following before proceeding; do NOT proceed until both pass:
   - **Structural check (layout guardrail)**: list the archive folder's immediate children (`ls -a aire-archives/epics/<EPIC-ID>-<epic-name-slug>/`) — it MUST contain EXACTLY `spec/`, `archive-manifest.md`, and (when the corresponding live folder exists) `reports/` and `runtime-artifacts/`. If any OTHER entry appears at this level (e.g. `requirements/`, `design/`, `aire-state.md`, `audit.md`), the copy was flattened instead of mirrored — redo Step 5.3 before continuing.
   - **Content check**: spot-check key files exist at their mirrored paths: `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`, `runtime-artifacts/audit.md`, `spec/plans/architecture.md`, `spec/plans/atlas-deep-dive.md`, one `spec/behavior/<work-unit>.feature`, and (when `reports/` was copied) one evidence file such as `reports/eval-evidence/<work-unit>/eval.json`.
   - 🔴 **Completeness check (BLOCKING — same for every cycle type)**: prove nothing was dropped, by comparing each live tree against its archived copy — every diff MUST be **completely empty**:
     ```bash
     diff <(cd spec && find . | sort) \
          <(cd "aire-archives/<type>/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/spec" && find . | sort)
     [ -d reports ] && diff <(cd reports && find . | sort) \
          <(cd "aire-archives/<type>/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/reports" && find . | sort)
     [ -d runtime-artifacts ] && diff <(cd runtime-artifacts && find . | sort) \
          <(cd "aire-archives/<type>/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/runtime-artifacts" && find . | sort)
     ```
     (PowerShell equivalent: `Compare-Object` on the `-Force` relative-path lists.)
     🔴 **Every diff must be empty.** Any line at all means the copy dropped or added something — re-run the full recursive copy of Step 5.3 and re-verify.
     **Do NOT proceed to Step 6 (which deletes the live docs) until every diff is empty.** Report the archived file count in the completion message and the manifest.
   - Log the structural check, the file count, and the completeness-diff result in the live `runtime-artifacts/audit.md` (Step 6 has not yet deleted it at this point).

**MANDATORY reference layout** — every archive folder produced by this skill MUST match this shape exactly (no exceptions, no variation between epic/bug/enhancement cycles):
```
aire-archives/epics/<EPIC-ID>-<epic-name-slug>/
├── spec/                  ← the ENTIRE spec/ tree, folder name preserved
│   ├── plans/                         ← architecture.md, atlas-deep-dive.md + flat RE docs, requirements,
│   │   │                                 Stories/Personas, design docs, dependency-graph.yml
│   │   └── delta/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/    ← this cycle's RE delta (Step 3) — stitched later on base
│   ├── spec-generation/               ← *-generation.md plan/clarifying-question files
│   ├── behavior/                       ← .feature contracts
│   ├── test-plans/                    ← ve manual test plans
│   ├── behavior.feature
│   ├── context-project/               ← human-curated inputs (kept on option-A reset)
│   └── …                         ← EVERY other folder/file that exists under spec/, at every depth
├── reports/                       ← the ENTIRE reports/ tree (generated outputs), when it exists
│   └── …                         ← unit / behavior / api-contract / eval evidence + reviews/ + code-security-reviews/ + ticket-summary/, at every depth
├── runtime-artifacts/             ← the ENTIRE runtime-artifacts/ tree, when it exists
│   ├── audit.md
│   └── aire-state.md
└── archive-manifest.md           ← sibling of spec/, reports/ and runtime-artifacts/, never inside them
```
(`bugs/<BUG-ID>-<slug>/` and `enhancements/<ENH-ID>-<slug>/` follow the identical shape and the identical full-tree contents — the folders shown above are illustrative, not a whitelist: archive whatever exists, nothing less.)

> The **latest cycle archive folder** is a complete snapshot of the cycle — workspace detection can offer to restore human-curated context from it when a new cycle starts. Current-system truth (`atlas-deep-dive.md` and the flat RE docs) is refreshed fresh from Atlas each cycle, not restored from the archive.

## Step 5.5: Collapse CI Manifest Fragments (MANDATORY)

`tests/.evals/ci-manifest.d/` is not part of the `spec/`/`reports/`/`runtime-artifacts/` mirror-and-reset
above — `tests/.evals/` persists across cycles at base, inherited by the next cycle "as-is"
(`common/directory-structure.md` Artifact Ownership). Left uncollapsed, every cycle's fragments would
keep accumulating in the next cycle's checkout forever. This is the ONE place they get folded back in.

1. If `tests/.evals/ci-manifest.d/` does not exist or is empty, log that there was nothing to collapse
   and skip to Step 6.
2. Otherwise, merge every `tests/.evals/ci-manifest.d/*.json` fragment into `tests/.evals/config.json`'s
   `ci.roots[]` array, using the SAME filename-sorted, root-keyed merge
   `tests/.evals/scripts/run-static-evals.*` already performs at every gate run
   (`common/ci-pipeline-generation.md` Section 4.0f.1) — never a different, ad hoc merge here. Write the
   merged `roots[]` directly into `config.json`, and set `ci.manifestState: "resolved"` if it was
   `"unresolved"` and at least one root now exists.
3. **Delete every file under `tests/.evals/ci-manifest.d/`** (the directory itself may remain, empty) —
   their content is now permanently part of `config.json`.
4. **Verify before proceeding**: re-run `tests/.evals/scripts/validate-pipeline.{sh,ps1}` against the
   collapsed `config.json` and confirm it still passes (in particular **V28/V30** — every root's
   directory and marker file still verify) before this becomes what the next cycle inherits.
5. Log the collapse in `runtime-artifacts/audit.md` (still live at this point, before Step 6 deletes
   it): which fragments were collapsed, the resulting `roots[]` count, and the `validate-pipeline`
   result.

## Step 6: Remove the Live Trees (AUTOMATIC — no confirmation, in every mode)

🔴 **THIS STEP ASKS NOTHING.** Not in epic mode, not in bug or enhancement mode, not on a standalone
invocation. The archive's own **verification** is the gate — Step 5's structural check, content check
and three empty completeness diffs. Once those pass, the live trees are redundant by proof, and a
confirmation prompt on top of a byte-for-byte verified copy adds no safety, only a stall in the middle
of a cycle close.

**Announce it, then do it:**

```
 Archive verified at aire-archives/<type>/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/ ([N] files, [size]).
   Removing the live spec/, reports/ and runtime-artifacts/ trees — all three mirrored,
   all three completeness diffs empty.
   Human-authored context is preserved at:
     aire-archives/<type>/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/spec/context-project/
```

### 6.1 The removal itself — 🔴 use `git rm -r`, not `rm -rf`

```bash
git rm -r --quiet spec reports runtime-artifacts
```

- **Why `git rm -r` and not `rm -rf`**: it removes the files **and stages the deletions in one
  operation**, so Step 6.5 cannot commit a partial reset by forgetting to stage a removal. It also
  fails loudly on a path that is not tracked, rather than silently destroying untracked work.
- `reports/` is legitimately absent on a cycle that produced no outputs — omit any path that does not
  exist rather than letting the command fail on it.
- **Untracked residue** (tool caches, an untracked evidence file) survives `git rm`. Clean only what is
  genuinely left inside those three roots:
  ```bash
  git clean -fd spec reports runtime-artifacts
  ```
  🔴 Never widen that to the repo root, and never add `-x` (it would delete ignored files elsewhere).
- 🔴 **If the environment's own safety classifier prompts for approval on the delete command, that is an
  environment permission, not an archive-epic gate.** Answer it and continue — do **not** add a question
  of your own on top of it, and do not treat the prompt as a reason to skip the removal.

### 6.2 Preconditions — assert, do not ask

All three must hold before the command runs. Any failure → STOP and fix, never prompt for permission to
proceed anyway:

1. Step 5's completeness diffs were run and were **all empty**.
2. `<archive>/spec/` exists (and `<archive>/reports/`, `<archive>/runtime-artifacts/` for whichever live
   trees exist). If `<archive>/spec/` is missing, redo Step 5.
3. `git status` shows the three roots as tracked paths about to be deleted — nothing outside them.

🔴 **THERE ARE NO SURVIVORS — `spec/` is removed in FULL**, `plans/` (including `atlas-deep-dive.md` and
this cycle's `plans/delta/`), `spec-generation/`, `behavior/`, `test-plans/`, `behavior.feature` and
`context-project/` alike, together with `reports/` and `runtime-artifacts/`. 🔴 **Do NOT keep
`atlas-deep-dive.md` or `plans/delta/` back for the stitch** — `stitch-delta` reads the delta out of the
archive, on base, after this PR merges. Leaving a shared, per-cycle-rewritten file on base is the one
thing that made this flow conflict-prone.

🔴 **`runtime-artifacts/audit.md` and `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` go with everything else — do NOT
seed a replacement.** The archive copy holds the cycle's complete trail; the next cycle's Workspace
Detection creates fresh ones. This is also what keeps parallel cycles conflict-free: no two PRs carry
competing audit/state files onto the base branch.

**MANDATORY**: From this point on the live `runtime-artifacts/audit.md` no longer exists — log the
removal and everything in Step 6.5 by APPENDING to the **archived** copy at
`aire-archives/<type>/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/runtime-artifacts/audit.md`, so the trail stays complete.

---

## Step 6.5: Commit, Push & Ensure the PR (AUTOMATIC — no confirmation)

Everything this skill produced so far exists only in the working tree. 🔴 **If it is not committed and
pushed, the cycle PR will NOT carry the archive or the workspace reset.** So this step asks nothing
either — it commits, pushes, and makes sure a PR exists, announcing each action as it goes.

1. **Stage the cycle-close changes**:
   - `aire-archives/<type>/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/` (the verified archive — includes the mirrored `spec/`,
     `reports/` and `runtime-artifacts/`, and therefore this cycle's delta)
   - The Step 6 removals — already staged by `git rm -r`; confirm with `git status` that all three roots
     show as deletions and that nothing outside them was touched
   - The Step 5.5 collapse: `tests/.evals/config.json` (updated `ci.roots[]`/`manifestState`) and the
     deleted `tests/.evals/ci-manifest.d/*.json` fragment files
   - 🔴 **Nothing under `aire-archives/stitch-ledger.md`** — this skill never writes it (Step 3.5)
2. **Commit on the current (cycle) branch**, with the `AIRE-Version:` trailer read **live** from the
   canonical `AIRE Framework Version` line in `CLAUDE.md` — 🔴 never hardcode the number:
   ```
   docs: close cycle <CYCLE-ID> — release archive, workspace reset

   AIRE-Version: [N]
   ```
3. **Push to origin automatically** — `git push origin <cycle-branch>`, then verify
   (`git log origin/<cycle-branch> -1`). 🔴 No confirmation: the cycle-close commit is worthless off
   origin, and the user already chose to close the cycle by invoking this skill.
   - On a rejected push (branch moved): `git fetch` + rebase onto `origin/<cycle-branch>`, re-verify the
     archive paths survived the rebase, and retry once. If it still fails, report the exact git error
     and STOP — never force-push a cycle branch.
4. **Ensure the PR exists — automatic, in every cycle type**:
   - `gh pr list --head <cycle-branch> --state open --json number,url,title`
   - **A PR is already open** (the normal case — `[EPIC]` raised by `pr-generator` just before it
     auto-triggered this skill, or the `[BUG]`/`[ENH]` raised by the implement workflow): it tracks the
     branch, so the push above already added the commit. Verify that (`gh pr view <n> --json commits`)
     and continue.
   - **No PR is open**: raise it now by invoking the **`pr-generator`** skill in **WORKFLOW mode**,
     passing **target branch = the Base Branch** recorded in `## Branching` — workflow mode skips its
     Phase 5 confirmation, so the push and PR happen automatically. It applies the correct
     `[EPIC]`/`[BUG]`/`[ENH]` prefix and the `ai-generated` + `aire-v[N]` labels itself. 🔴 Never
     hand-roll a `gh pr create` here — pr-generator owns PR mechanics.
5. **Update the PR description** so reviewers aren't surprised by the cycle-close diff: fetch the current
   body (`gh pr view <PR> --json body`) and append (via `gh pr edit <PR> --body ...`, never replacing the
   existing content):
   ```markdown
   ##  Cycle-Close Commit (added after PR creation)
   This PR also includes the cycle-close commit from `archive-epic`:
   - **Added**: release archive at `aire-archives/<EPIC-ID>-<slug>/` (complete `spec/` + `reports/` + `runtime-artifacts/` snapshot incl. audit trail and state)
   - **Added**: this cycle's RE delta ([N] changed surfaces), archived at `aire-archives/<type>/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/spec/plans/delta/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/`
   - **Removed**: the live `spec/` tree in full (including `context-project/`), the `reports/` tree, and `runtime-artifacts/` (`audit.md`, `aire-state.md`) — all mirrored in the archive above
   - ➡ **After merging**, run `/stitch-delta` on `<base-branch>`: it reads the delta from that archive and publishes it to the deep dive on Atlas. Its own PR is a single ledger row.
   ```

---

## Step 7: Completion Message

```markdown
# Cycle Archive Complete

- **Archive**: `aire-archives/<EPIC-ID>-<epic-name-slug>/`
- **Contents**: `spec/` (all planning/design artifacts, every work-unit `.feature`) + `reports/` (generated outputs) + `runtime-artifacts/` (audit.md, aire-state.md)
- **Delta**: [N] stitch directive(s), commit range [base-sha]..[head-sha] — archived at
  `aire-archives/<type>/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/spec/plans/delta/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/delta.md`
  ↳ pending until `/stitch-delta` publishes it (it has no ledger row yet — that IS the pending signal)
- **Workspace**: `spec/`, `reports/` and `runtime-artifacts/` removed — all mirrored in the archive
  ↳ human-authored context to restore next cycle: `aire-archives/<type>/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/spec/context-project/`
- **Cycle-close commit**: pushed to `origin/<cycle-branch>` — included in PR <URL> [| PR raised via pr-generator: <URL>]

➡ NEXT ACTION — in order:
   1⃣  Merge the open PR into `<base-branch>`: <PR URL>
       (the cycle-close commit above rides this PR)

   2⃣  On `<base-branch>`, after that merge, type: /stitch-delta
       It reads this delta from the archive and publishes it to the deep dive on Atlas via the
       Helix MCP, then appends one ledger row — in its own PR for you to review.

🔴 Type `/stitch-delta` EXACTLY as shown — the cycle is not closed until the delta reaches Atlas.
```

**Rules for this message**:
- Substitute every placeholder with real values (`<base-branch>` and the PR URL from `## Branching` / `gh pr list`) — never ship a placeholder to the user.
- The push is automatic, so there is no "not pushed" variant of this message. If the push genuinely **failed** (Step 6.5 item 3 exhausted its one retry), do not print this completion block at all — report the exact git error and STOP, so the failure is not dressed up as a successful close.
- Output **nothing after this block** — no options menu, no further suggestions.

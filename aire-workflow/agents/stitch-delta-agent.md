# Stitch Delta Agent — Refresh the Atlas Deep Dive to the Current Face of the Application

**Role**: you are a **release librarian**. A cycle has closed, archived itself, and merged into base.
Your job is to make the **deep dive document on Atlas** describe the application **as it is now** —
completely, with no content left over from before this cycle — and to record that you did.

**When this runs**: on the **base branch**, **AFTER** the cycle's PR (`[EPIC]`, `[BUG]` or `[ENH]`)
has merged into it. That timing is what makes the refresh possible: the merged code is right there in
the working tree to ground every factual section against.

🔴 **THE DELIVERABLE IS A WHOLLY CURRENT DOCUMENT, NOT A SET OF EDITS.** A deep dive is a full system
analysis — directory structure, statistics, entry points, component catalog, flows, dependency graph,
database, test coverage, security posture, technical debt, file inventory. A real cycle invalidates
most of it at once. **Every section that is no longer true MUST be brought current in this run**, whether
or not the cycle's `delta.md` happened to name it. A document that is 90% current is a document nobody
can trust, because no reader can tell which 10% is stale.

🔴 **This supersedes the earlier "apply only the delta's directives, never widen scope" rule.** That rule
produced exactly the failure this file now exists to prevent: an epic added `src/organization/`,
`src/team/`, `src/admin/` and `scripts/seed.ts`, the delta named seven sections, and `### Directory
Structure` — along with Statistics, Entry Points, the Component Catalog and the File Inventory — was
knowingly left describing a codebase that no longer existed. **Widening is now REQUIRED wherever a
section is stale.** The delta tells you what the cycle intended and why; the merged code tells you what
is true; the document must end up matching the code.

---

## Why this shape — read before changing anything here

| Property | Why it holds |
|---|---|
| **The document ends current** | Every section is checked against the merged code, not against the delta's coverage. The delta cannot cause a silent gap, because it is not the scope boundary. |
| **Nothing can conflict in git** | Base has no `spec/` after a cycle closes, and this agent's entire repository footprint is one appended ledger row plus archived audit entries. |
| **The delta cannot be lost** | It lives in the immutable cycle archive, not a working tree that gets reset. |
| **A delta cannot be applied twice** | Two independent guards — the ledger row and the stitch marker in the document itself (Step 2.2). |

---

## Step 0: Load the Source Rules

**MANDATORY** — read these before doing anything:
- `common/helix-atlas-integration.md` — resolving the Helix MCP provider and the Atlas document, and
  the provenance rules that apply in the write direction
- `agents/archive-epic-agent.md` **Step 3** — the delta schema: what `delta.md` records about the cycle
- `common/content-validation.md` — validation for the document you write back
- `common/audit-logging.md` — this run's entries and its timestamp rule

---

## Step 1: Preconditions

1. **Resolve the base branch.** `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` does not exist at this point — the
   cycle deleted it. Resolve in order, announcing which was used:
   1. The repository's default branch (`gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name`).
   2. The `Base Branch` recorded in the most recent archive's
      `aire-archives/<type>/<ID>-<slug>/runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`.
   3. Ask the user, naming what you found.
2. **Be on it, and be current**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin && git checkout <base-branch> && git pull --ff-only
   ```
   🔴 Dirty tree → STOP and show `git status`. Never stash or discard the user's work.
   🔴 **The working tree must be the merged post-cycle state** — that is the ground truth Step 4 reads.
3. **Verify each candidate cycle actually merged** (`gh pr view <PR> --json state,mergedAt,baseRefName`,
   or the merge commit in `git log`). 🔴 An unmerged cycle is **skipped, not stitched** — publishing an
   analysis of code that is not on base is the one failure this precondition prevents.
   - **`custom-branching-strategy`**: if the cycle PR targeted an intermediate branch (`dev`, `qa`,
     `preprod`), this agent still runs on **base only**, once the code has landed there.
4. 🔴 **ONE STITCH RUN AT A TIME — refuse to start while a `stitch-delta/*` PR is open.**
   ```bash
   gh pr list --state open --search "head:stitch-delta/" --json number,title,url
   ```
   Its ledger rows are not on base until it merges, so a second run would re-discover those deltas as
   pending. **One or more open** → STOP with nothing written:
   ```
    A stitch-delta PR is already open and unmerged:
      • <url> — <title>

   Its ledger rows are not on <base-branch> yet, so this run would re-discover those deltas as
   pending. Merge (or close) that PR, pull <base-branch>, then re-run /stitch-delta.
   ```

🔴 **No open-CYCLE-branch check is needed** — this run touches no `spec/` path.

---

## Step 2: Discover Pending Deltas

### 2.1 The ledger

**`aire-archives/stitch-ledger.md`** — the record of what has been published. Written by **this agent
alone**, strictly **append-only**: one row per successful refresh, appended after the Atlas write
verifies. Rows are never edited, re-ordered or removed.

```markdown
# Stitch Ledger — cycle deltas published to the Atlas deep dive
<!-- Append-only. One row per stitched delta, written by stitch-delta after the Atlas write verifies. -->

| Cycle | Ticket | Delta Folder | Stitched At | Commit Range | Atlas Doc | Atlas Version | Sections Updated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| epic | PROJ-50 | PROJ-50-payment-portal | 2026-01-14T09:22:11Z | a1b2c3d..e4f5a6b | 3509 | 15 | 23 of 80 (full-document refresh) |
```

- **`Delta Folder` is the idempotency key** — `<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>`, unique per cycle.
- 🔴 **There is no "pending" row.** A delta is pending precisely because it has **no row**. Absence is
  the signal, which keeps every write a pure append.
- 🔴 An older ledger with pending rows or different columns: **migrate in place once**, keeping every row
  that records a real stitch and dropping `Stitched At: —` rows (they re-derive as pending).

### 2.2 Two independent guards against a double refresh

1. **Ledger row present** → already published. Skip.
2. **Stitch marker present** → the document header carries one `> **Stitched**: <CYCLE-ID> at <ts>` line
   per published cycle (Step 4.6). Marker in the Atlas body but **no ledger row** = the write landed and
   the ledger write did not. 🔴 **Do NOT refresh again.** Write the missing row from the marker's
   timestamp and the document's current version, announce the self-heal, move on.

🔴 Check guard 2 against the **live Atlas body**, not a cached read — it is the only guard that survives
a lost or reverted ledger.

### 2.3 Discovery

1. Glob archived deltas: `ls -d aire-archives/*/*/spec/plans/delta/*/ 2>/dev/null`
2. Drop any with a ledger row (guard 1); drop any whose cycle PR is not merged (Step 1.3).
3. **Order by merge order** — the `**Archived**:` timestamp in each archive's `archive-manifest.md`,
   falling back to the cycle's merge-commit date. Oldest first.
4. **Several pending deltas → ONE refresh pass, not N.** Read them all, then perform a single
   full-document refresh reflecting the cumulative current state, and append one ledger row per delta
   (all naming the same resulting Atlas version). Refreshing serially would re-analyse the same merged
   tree several times and produce identical output each time.
5. Nothing pending → report and STOP. A normal outcome:
   ```
    Nothing to stitch — every archived delta already has a row in
      aire-archives/stitch-ledger.md. The Atlas deep dive is up to date.
   ```

---

## Step 3: Resolve the Atlas Deep-Dive Document

Resolve the Helix MCP provider per `common/helix-atlas-integration.md` Section 3 (runtime discovery —
🔴 never hardcode tool names), then:

1. List the solution documents available to this session (the Helix DOCS listing tool).
2. **Match the deep dive for this estate** — the archived `spec/plans/atlas-deep-dive.md` opens with the
   provenance block naming the server, estate and document it was pulled from. Use that first, then the
   title/type match.
3. **Exactly one match** → bind it; record `document_id` and `version`.
4. **Several plausible matches** → 🔴 ask which one, listing what you found. Writing an estate's analysis
   into the wrong org document is worse than one question.
5. **No provider, or no deep-dive document** → 🔴 **HALT**, nothing written:
   ```
    HELIX MCP REQUIRED — cannot publish the refresh

      <n> delta(s) are pending, but [no Helix MCP server is connected in this session |
      Atlas has no deep dive document for this estate].

      Nothing was written. The deltas stay in their archives and stay pending, so this run
      repeats as-is once Helix is connected.

    ➡ Connect Helix (or generate the deep dive on Atlas), then re-run /stitch-delta on <base-branch>.
   ```

---

## Step 4: 🔴 FULL-DOCUMENT REFRESH — every section, grounded in the merged code

This is the heart of the run. The output is a **complete replacement body** for the Atlas document that
describes the application as it exists on base right now.

### 4.1 Read the three inputs

| Input | Role |
|---|---|
| **The live Atlas document** (full view) | The current published text. Its **outline is the section contract** — you refresh in place, you do not restructure. Record its `version`. |
| **Every pending `delta.md`** | What each cycle intended to change, and why — the narrative and the traceability (commit ranges, tickets). |
| 🔴 **The merged working tree on base** | **The ground truth.** Every factual claim in the refreshed document is verified against the real code, not against the delta's description of it. |

### 4.2 Enumerate the document's own sections — this is the coverage checklist

Read the document's outline (headings-only view) and build the full list. A deep dive typically runs
60–90 headings across areas like: Executive Summary · System Overview · Complexity Assessment · Critical
Findings · Risk Assessment · **Directory Structure** · **Technology Stack** · **Comprehensive
Statistics** · **Entry Points** · Architectural Style & Patterns · Architecture Diagrams · **Component
Catalog** · **Flow Analysis** (one per flow) · **Internal/External Dependencies** · Coupling Metrics ·
Circular Dependencies · **Database Analysis** · Quality Assessment · Complexity Metrics · Code
Duplication · **Code Smells** · **Technical Debt** · **Test Coverage** · Testing Gaps · **Security**
(per concern) · Performance · Documentation Audit · **Recommendations** · Getting Started · Quick
Reference · **Appendices (File Inventory, Dependency List, Metrics, Diagrams)** · **Referenced Paths**.

🔴 **The checklist is the document's ACTUAL outline, never this illustrative list.** Read it.

### 4.3 Decide every section against the code — three outcomes, no fourth

For **every** heading in that checklist:

| Outcome | When | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| **REFRESH** | The section makes a factual claim the merged code no longer supports | Rewrite it from the real tree. |
| **KEEP** | Re-verified against the code and still accurate | Leave byte-identical. |
| **REMOVE/RESOLVE** | It describes something that no longer exists (a resolved anti-pattern, a deleted module, a closed debt item) | Update or strike it, noting the cycle that resolved it. |

🔴 **"Not named in the delta" is NOT a reason to KEEP.** KEEP requires positive re-verification against
the code. The observed failure was exactly this: a section left alone because no directive pointed at it.

🔴 **Sections that are almost always stale after a real cycle** — check these explicitly, every run:
Directory Structure · Comprehensive Statistics (file/LOC counts) · Entry Points · Component Catalog ·
Internal Dependencies + Coupling · Database Analysis (schema changes) · Test Coverage · Appendix file
inventory · Appendix dependency list · Referenced Paths.

### 4.4 Grounding commands — read the real tree, do not infer

Derive facts from the repository, not from the delta's prose. Adapt to the stack:

```bash
git diff --name-status <base-sha>..<head-sha>      # what the cycle actually changed
git ls-files | sed 's#/[^/]*$##' | sort -u         # real directory structure
git ls-files | wc -l                                # real file count
cat package.json requirements.txt pom.xml go.mod 2>/dev/null   # real dependency set
```

🔴 **Every number in the refreshed document is measured, never carried forward and never estimated.**
A stale statistic is indistinguishable from a fabricated one to a reader.

### 4.5 Preserve what is not yours to change

- **Structure**: same headings, same order, same depth. Refresh *content*; do not restructure the
  analysis. If the cycle genuinely introduces a new area (a new flow, a new service), add a section in
  the matching pattern and say so in the ledger's `Sections Updated`.
- **Human-authored commentary** that remains true — judgement calls, rationale, recommendations still
  open — is preserved verbatim.
- **Title and metadata** are unchanged. The header's `**Status:**` / `**Steps Completed:**` line stays as
  the document defines it.
- 🔴 **`## Referenced Paths` is MANDATORY and must end the document** (High / Medium / Low relevance) —
  the Helix save contract requires it for markdown. Regenerate it from the files this refresh actually
  examined; never drop it and never leave it stale.

### 4.6 Write the header provenance

Add to the document header, one line per published cycle (cumulative — never replace prior lines):

```
> **Stitched**: <CYCLE-ID> at <ISO 8601 timestamp> · commit <base-sha>..<head-sha>
```

🔴 Guard 2 reads these. A refresh published without its marker is invisible to the recovery path.

### 4.7 Publish

1. **Re-read the document's `version`** immediately before writing. If it moved since Step 4.1, someone
   edited it on Atlas meanwhile: **re-read the body, redo the 4.3 pass against it, and write from that** —
   🔴 never blind-overwrite a newer version.
2. **Write the complete refreshed body back to the same `document_id`** using the Helix full-replace
   document tool. A whole-document refresh is a whole-document write; a per-section edit tool is the
   wrong instrument when most of the document moved.
3. **Verify**: re-read the document and confirm the refreshed sections are present, the outline is
   unchanged in structure, `## Referenced Paths` closes it, and every stitch marker is there. Record the
   new `version`.
4. **On a failed or partial write**: STOP. Report what landed, write **no** ledger row (the delta stays
   pending, so the re-run is safe and idempotent), and do not continue.

🔴 **Never publish a refresh you could not verify**, and never "tidy" beyond bringing content current —
a refresh is an accuracy operation, not an editorial one.

---

## Step 5: Append the Ledger Row(s)

Immediately after the Atlas write verifies, **append** one row per published delta: cycle type, ticket,
delta folder, an ISO 8601 timestamp from a real clock (`common/audit-logging.md` Section 2), the commit
range, the `document_id`, the new `version`, and a `Sections Updated` count (`23 of 80`).

🔴 **Append only** — never rewrite, re-sort, or edit a row. 🔴 Write them immediately, never batched into
a later step, so a crash leaves the ledger truthful.

---

## Step 6: Commit and Raise the PR — 🔴 never directly to base

This run's whole repository diff is the appended ledger row(s) plus the archived audit entries.

1. `git checkout -b stitch-delta/<name>` — `<name>` = the ticket ID, or `-`-joined IDs when several were
   published together. Announce it; do not ask.
2. **Stage exactly** `aire-archives/stitch-ledger.md` and the archived `audit.md` files you appended.
   Anything else in `git status` → stop and investigate.
3. **Commit**, with the `AIRE-Version:` trailer read **live** from `CLAUDE.md` — never hardcoded:
   ```
   docs: refresh Atlas deep dive for <CYCLE-ID(s)>

   AIRE-Version: [N]
   ```
4. **Push and raise the PR** into base — title `[STITCH] <CYCLE-ID(s)> — Atlas deep dive refreshed`,
   labels **`ai-generated`** and **`aire-v[N]`**. The body states the `document_id`, the new `version`,
   how many sections were refreshed versus kept, the commit range, and the archive(s) read.
5. **On a race-rejected push**: fetch, rebase the stitch branch onto base, re-read the ledger, drop any
   delta published meanwhile, retry with `--force-with-lease` **on the stitch branch only**. 🔴 Never
   force-push base.

---

## Step 7: Audit Logging

`runtime-artifacts/audit.md` does not exist here. Append to each published cycle's archived copy at
`aire-archives/<type>/<CYCLE-ID>-<slug>/runtime-artifacts/audit.md`. Every entry carries
`**User Email**:`, an ISO 8601 timestamp from a real clock, and: the sections refreshed / kept /
resolved with the reason per section, the grounding commands run, the `document_id` and resulting
`version`, and the raw text of any user answer (Step 3.4).

---

## Step 8: Completion Message

```markdown
# Atlas Deep Dive Refreshed

- **Published**: [N] delta(s) — [CYCLE-ID list]
- **Document**: [title] (id [document_id]) — version [old] → [new]
- **Sections**: [r] refreshed · [k] kept (re-verified) · [x] resolved/removed · [total] total
  ↳ refreshed: [list the section names]
- **Grounded in**: `<base-branch>` @ [sha] — the merged post-cycle tree
- **Ledger**: `aire-archives/stitch-ledger.md` — [N] row(s) appended
- **PR**: [URL] — `stitch-delta/<name>` → `<base-branch>`

➡ NEXT ACTION:
   1⃣  Review and merge the PR above — it carries the ledger row(s) and the audit trail.
   2⃣  The next cycle pulls this refreshed deep dive from Atlas as its existing-system truth.
```

Substitute every placeholder. Output **nothing after this block**.

---

## Critical Rules

- 🔴 **The deliverable is a WHOLLY CURRENT document.** Every section is decided against the merged code:
  REFRESH, KEEP (only on positive re-verification) or REMOVE/RESOLVE. **"The delta didn't mention it" is
  never a reason to leave a section stale** — that rule is what let `### Directory Structure` describe a
  codebase that no longer existed.
- 🔴 **The merged working tree is the ground truth; the delta is the narrative.** Every fact, path,
  count and dependency is measured from the repo, never carried forward, never estimated.
- 🔴 **Refresh in place — never restructure.** Same headings, same order. New areas are added in the
  document's existing pattern and named in the ledger.
- 🔴 **`## Referenced Paths` must close the document**, regenerated from what this refresh examined — the
  Helix markdown save contract requires it.
- 🔴 **Base branch only, after the cycle PR merged.** An unmerged cycle is skipped, never published.
- 🔴 **Re-read the `version` immediately before writing**; if it moved, redo the pass against the new
  body. Never blind-overwrite a newer version. Verify by re-reading before writing the ledger.
- 🔴 **Two guards against a double publish**: the ledger row and the header stitch marker. Marker present
  + row missing → write the row, do **not** refresh again.
- 🔴 **Ledger is append-only, written by this agent alone**, immediately after the Atlas write verifies.
  No pending rows, no edits, no re-sorting.
- 🔴 **Several pending deltas = ONE refresh pass**, one row each, all naming the same resulting version.
- 🔴 **HALT if Helix/Atlas is unreachable** — nothing written, deltas stay safe in their archives.
- 🔴 **Never commit or push to base directly.** Always the `stitch-delta/<name>` branch + PR.
- 🔴 **Touch no `spec/`, `src/` or `tests/` path.** The repository footprint is the ledger row and the
  archived audit entries, nothing else.

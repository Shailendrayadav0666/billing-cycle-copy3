# behavior/run.sh — the SINGLE entry point for the Gherkin tiers. The developer, AIRE's local gate and
# CI all call `./tests/.evals/behavior/run.sh <tier>` so tier membership can never drift (Section 4.1b).
#
#   b1  this work unit's feature file only
#   b2  every OTHER ACTIVE feature file under spec/behavior/
#   b3  the whole ACTIVE cycle plus spec/behavior.feature (cross-story journeys) — last unit / base-branch PR
#
# 🔴 NO STUBS. A tier that cannot resolve any feature files exits NON-ZERO with the reason — it never
#    prints "ok" and exits 0 (Section 5.0). Tier membership is read from the spec/ layout here, never
#    duplicated in YAML.
#
# 🔴 THE ACTIVATION RULE (behavior-spec.md Section 6.0). EVERY work unit's .feature file is authored at
#    the STOP CHECKPOINT, before ANY code is generated (CLAUDE.md Step 1.7). So spec/behavior/ is fully
#    populated from the start, including units nobody has begun. Running those would fail the gate for
#    work never claimed to be done — a false negative, not a regression. A unit is ACTIVE when its
#    ## Story Tracker row in runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md is NOT "Ready for Development"; a unit with
#    no row, or no state file at all, counts as ACTIVE (conservative, preserves legacy behaviour).
#    B2/B3 run only ACTIVE files and PRINT the excluded ones. B1 is exempt — the unit being built is
#    active by definition.
#
# 🔴 exit 3 = N/A, in exactly these cases:
#    - spec/behavior/ contains ZERO feature files of ANY kind (no cycle in flight); or
#    - NO file is ACTIVE — the epic-level pre-handoff smoke test runs before any unit is started
#      (ci-pipeline-generation.md Section 4.0.6's documented "does NOT validate" scope), so every tier
#      is N/A there rather than a false ERROR; or
#    - the run's key is not a work unit at all (ci-*, ve-*) — all tiers N/A.
#    A tier that finds none of ITS OWN files while OTHER ACTIVE feature files exist is still a real
#    contract violation and stays exit 2 (ERROR).
